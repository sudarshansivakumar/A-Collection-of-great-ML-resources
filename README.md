# A-Collection-of-great-ML-resources
This is a list of resources which have helped me understand various Machine Learning concepts. I hope to start from basic ideas like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc. and move upto resources that cover more advanced topics like Neural Networks, RNNs, and CNNs
